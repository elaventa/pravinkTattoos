His studio is spotless, his equipment all brand new and his skill unquestionable. Because I was leaving station the next day he and his assistant worked for a solid 10 hours on my back and i am totally 100% pleases with the result. I'll finish by saying, if you are in Palolem, South Goa or anywhere near and want a tattoo, you will not find better",

I never imagined getting a tattoo would be such a nice and painless experience. It was my first tattoo and I went for 2 at a time and I am really happy with how my tattoo looks now. He is available for any questions you have after getting inked. I followed everything told by him and the results were great. I will get my next tattoo from him when I visit Goa (Palolem) the next time. Thank you so much 😊 I convinced my husband to get one and he is happy too.",

It’s very important to feel comfortable with your tattoo guy, especially when you do intimacy tattoo like this. Pravin made me feel so comfortable. He made the tattoo so gentle and calm, and the results went amazing!!! Thank you 🙏🏼💓",

We met Pravin who's the main artist here and I can say he deserve to be known for his work. He has great talent and very focused on details. My boyfriend ended up having 3 tattoos as a first timer lol, and I did my 3rd and 4th small tats.For anyone visiting South Goa and interested to do a tattoo, I highly recommend to visit this shop in Palolem. They use modern gun machines, they would show you the unpacked sterile needle with date and ofcourse they keep good hygeine in the place which is an important aspect. The price is reasonable as well, but again it depends on the work to be done. ",
